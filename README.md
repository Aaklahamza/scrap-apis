# Scrap

This project was mainly a data engineering project.

- Different apis to scrap data from social media.
- Extract multiple informations based on keywords.
## Fun parts: 
- It was fun to learn about the format of raw data, to process it in order to use it in models. 
- This work has made me appreciate the organized data that i usually work with in data science project.
### PS :
- This project was during an internship, so other apis were developped for facebook, instagram and youtube by my collegues, and i had the opportunity to work on them as well and follow their progress.
